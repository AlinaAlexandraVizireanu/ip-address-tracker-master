## Overview

This project represents a web application which allow users to find the location of the requested ip address or domain name.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

I started this project by checking the design on the Figma file, then I created the website's structure with HTML and then used CSS to implement the style.
The logic part of the application was built with JavaScript where I made an HTTP request using AXIOS.
To get the IP Address locations I've used the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) and to generate the map I've used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) - For IP Address and domain
- [[LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) - For the map

### What I learned

In the process of building the website, I've improved my knowledge regarding HTTP requests and I've learned how to implement the requested data in the webpage.
